  best_practices:
    for_developers:
      - "Set EXA_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY or OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variables"
      - "Agent initializes lazily on first request"
      - "Async handler function processes messages"
      - "Uses Agno framework for agent orchestration"

    for_orchestrators:
      - "Route web research queries to this agent"
      - "Expect async task processing with submitted/completed states"
      - "Processing time typically 10-30 seconds depending on query complexity"
      - "Agent returns markdown-formatted reports in artifacts"
      - "Use tasks/get endpoint to poll for completion"
